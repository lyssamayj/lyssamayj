- 👋 Hi, I’m Lyssa Samuel.
- 👀 I’m interested in data engineering and data science.
- I'm particularly interested in working on software that enhances the healthcare setting and/or social and behavioral sciences.
- My personal passion is to use data to transform mental health and substance use treatment or prevention.
- My dream would be to work for large mental health data collectors, such as SAMHSA or NIMH, and change the way our society operates by using data to fill the gaps our current societal systems.

- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on learning python & R, and ML & data infastructure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any data science project related to health and mental health.
