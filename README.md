- 👋 Hi, I’m Lyssa Samuel.
- 👀 I’m interested in data engineering and potentially data science.
- I'm particularly interested in working with data from the social/behavioral sciences.
- My ultimate passion is to use data to transform mental health and substance use treatment or prevention.
- My dream would be to work for large mental health data collectors, such as SAMHSA or NIMH, and change the way our society operates.

- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on learning python & R, and ML & data infastructure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any data science project related to health and mental health.
